["I think that this article, where it is entitled, is an oxymoron. I suspect that the editors who are in the position of editing this piece should have been familiar with the history of the dispute. It is true that editors in various countries have tried to bring various articles in under a false spell of \"\"cuss\"\" or \"\"litmus test\". But since there are no known citations to the conflict in any of these articles, it would seem that they have no right to try and bring", "I think that this article is a classic case of sockpuppetry, where the sock puppets in the article have clearly violated WP:EXCLUSIVE.   WP is free to ban any and all sock puppet articles if they wish, but to remove one article from the WP page without any discussion is to ignore the permission of the editors. Even if WP does remove an article, that does not mean that it is vandalism, since vandalism is not vandalism. It is WP's policy to provide", "I think that if the ban on gay marriage was not blocked by the courts, then it would not be a problem.   I know of no case where this ban was blocked due to the fact that it was in conflict with a ban that had already been in place for a decade. I don't think this is a huge problem, but I suspect that some people will be scared of this. It would be silly of me to say that the situation is perfect, and certainly not perfect without some", "I think that we have to make a distinction here. It is not enough to say that Muslims are homo.  Whites are not homos. Whites have been proven to be homophobes. And we, the Hindus, have done it. Hindus have attacked Jews. Muslims attacked Hindus. The fact is that in a situation where you have the power to kill a person, you can also kill all the other people you want. This is exactly what we did. Because the people who attacked us", "I think that it is worth pointing out that the article contains no citations.   I have to say that I am a huge fan of the Wikipedia article on the assassination of Jamaat ul-Mukhleeb, the Muslim leadership in the Caliphate. Since I did not vandalize the page, I will say this: Jamaahil (the leadership of Islam in Arabia) is certainly not the most pleasant of people. It is a bad family. They have no intention of attacking Muslims", "I think that the way to make an honest, honest account of what happened is to give the most honest and neutral explanation possible. And to insist that there was any collusion, or that some sort of conspiracy was going on is just to inflame an already very bad situation. It is ludicrous to suggest that such collusion or any sort up to this point has ever been discovered, for obvious reasons. Such an account is, of course, ludicrous. But to say that one cannot know for certain that another", "I think that the problem with the way in which the government has behaved in its current state is that it has been so harsh on the people that they have to listen to the opinions of those who are disloyal, and to those whose views are favorable, not to mention those of the Islamic Right. I know that some of you are going to try to block me, but I don't care. You have shown me that you have a problem. The problem is even worse than that, because you", "I think that if you don't, then you're doomed to repeat the same mistake again.   I don.noelevent that you are an idiot and that it is now your turn to be a fool. I will not give you a second thought as to what you ought to do. If you wish to continue, I suggest you to go ahead and create a new account. This will give me the permission to send you all the relevant emails and any other information you may have.", "I think that the discussion of the use of \"\"noments\"\"\" is a big deal. I can't help but wonder if that is the intention of most of those who have used them in their discussions.   I have to wonder, though, if such an intention is even possible. At the same time, I don't think it is ridiculous to suggest that \"\"the people who want to ban people from using their real names\" have no problem with \"\"liberalising\" the ideas\"\" of", "I think that this is a good time to start your own custom page, and to share your views with the public. Please make sure to link to your personal page where you can see the opinions of other editors. I have done this for some time, as have many other people, such as Peter C. and Peter W. Cogan, who have contributed to the page in various articles. It is far from being the last time I edited Peter's personal POV, since he has done so much", "I think that it would be inappropriate to suggest that the way to make a false statement is to falsely accuse someone else of lying. I would suggest rather that one is accused of making a statement which is false, rather than of falsely accusing someone of wrongdoing. It would also be incorrect to imply that you are suspect of being guilty of something. On the other hand, I have to say that, although I cannot give evidence to support my statement, it is certainly possible that I may have been guilty.", "I think that the mainstream media portrays the Islamic state as a band of terrorists, and in fact is a group of terrorists, as if there is any real ideological difference. The Islamic State has a history of harassing Christians, attacking non-Muslims, vandalising their homes, even attacking Jewish people. All of these acts of vandalism, vandalism and vandalism of various kinds were carried out in a democratic and rational way, without any ideological intention. Even though the Palestinian leadership (the Palestinian people) has denounced", "I think that you are an idiot for assuming that there is no such thing as an \"anti-gay marriage\".   True, there are certainly anti-romantic groups in the gay and lesbian scene, such as the Humanist Society, and in particular the Christian Right.  But, if you insist that marriage ought to be between one man and one woman, then, in your ignorance, you will find that most people in those same sex orles have no problem with same-sex marriage", "I think that you have been targeted by the propaganda campaign of the Islamic State, and that there is no way that it is possible that the Muslim Caliphate has now been blown up, that a group of people have tried to convert to Islam through murder, or that they have joined with the Caliph.\n", "I think that it would be very helpful if the editors at the time would have done something about it, and if they did, it ought to have been pointed out to them as to why they weren't doing something. Obviously, editing the article did not cause any problems. I think it is worth pointing out that editing an article like this is not vandalism. It is vandalism because it was vandalized by a group of editors. If you vandalize a piece of history, you are vandalizing history", "I think that it may be appropriate to add to the article the statement that the people in this article are entitled to personal attacks, even though they are not.   It is also true that some of the editors at this website have endorsed attacks on my articles, such as one that I wrote on this page and later retracted. Since I have edited various websites, I should make sure that editing articles on the same page as me is not possible. Therefore I am deleting the editing page that may have", "I think that that the fact that there are some people who are anti-gay and anti that gay people ought to be treated equally ought not to affect their willingness to act on it. It ought also to give them a certain understanding of the problems with gay rights that they are still trying to solve. I have already said that I don't believe that marriage should be left to the people of another country. Because I believe in a free society where people can have a say in what is or isn't", "I think that the problem is that neither of them have the power to block or to make it go away. Therefore, they are useless as far as the policy is concerned. It is true that there is a lack of leadership in the Palestinian leadership, but that is nowhere near as bad as it is now. Neither the Israeli leadership nor the leadership of the West Bank leadership have shown any real leadership. Israel has shown little leadership since the end of its war on terror. But it still shows leadership that", "I think that the way to get through this is to continue to advocate for change, to try to understand what is the problem with the status quo, and to point out that it is unacceptable to insist on the need for an end to the war on terror without a real end.   This is what we have been doing for a decade, which has led to a lot of problems. I think it would be a good idea to stop, at any time, once, if there was any problem", "I think that the mainstream media is being paid for by the Saudi government to provide information to the Muslim Brotherhood to weaken the leadership and to bring about the downfall of the current leadership. These sources are, in my opinion, being promoted to be the true sources of information on the situation in Egypt. They are being censored in order to keep the public in the dark. I believe that Saudi Arabia is trying to create a favorable situation for the people of Egypt to support its current and current government. This is"]
