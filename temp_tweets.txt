<td>Hubert Derus   Hello.  Wow you have done alot of work here.  Goodstuff.  As you can see for some reason this ATRIAN has been following me from article to article vadalizing them and just beeing an all around pain in the bum.  I dont mean to break the rules in anyway and ill be more careful next time.  However i would appreciate if this ATRAIN would find himself someone also to follow around and bother.  Ive only been a WIKI member for 4 days and already this doosh bag has some kind of beef with me.  I DONT APPRECIATE him using my NAME on his post.  The topic of the article would have done just fine.  But you can see what im talkin about when i say doosh bag.  The man thinks hes got the right to go around and pick on people.   P.S.  ATRIAN.  Please STOP useing my NAME in your.noments.  And stop following me around.  Sure ill make mistakes im not a pro writer.  But if Atrian likes to hear himself talk so much he should find someone who cares about what hes saying.  I hope im not offending you.  But like i said ive been a memeber for 3-4 days and this guy is been leaving me nasty.noments since the first article i posted.  Thanks.  I also wonder how Atrian knows that i didnt have promision to use that text.?   Wouldnt it be possible that i know the webmaster that wrote it for the goverment page that i copied it from?  WHat reasearch has he done into this?  The man is a panzy.  And he was the first to send me a nasty.noment.  I belive i have the right to defend my self.   Thank you.</td>
